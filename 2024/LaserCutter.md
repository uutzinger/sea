## How to Get Laser Going
- Toggle the switch on the Table. The air pump needs to vibrate, the fan needs to make noise, the chiller needs to show about 22 centi grades.
- If all looks ok start the laser by turning the key (perhaps you also need to turn and release the emergency button). 
- Load your DXF file into RDWorks on the laser cutter computer.

Select all the objects and adjust the cutting properties by clicking on the colors on the top right. See the laserworks image above.
- The cutting color needs to cut with 40mm/s and 95% power
- The text color needs to cut with 350mm/s and 80% power

- Select all the objects and click Upload. Give a short filename. Acknowledge the Upload.
- On the laser push file, select your file. It should look like on the computer screen.

- Place the wood on top of the cutting bed.
- Push ESC and then move the cutting head with the arrows to the top right corner of the board. Push Origin.
- Push ESC, then Z/U and select autofocus. Let the machine focus.
- Push Z/U select Z and make sure it reads about 6mm. Use the left/right arrows to adjust.
- Push ESC, then Frame and make sure the object fits onto the board as the laser head draws the outline of all objects. If it does not fit, move the board.

- Finally cut the parts with buttom right button.
